# Top-Down Wave Survival Game

A top-down action game built with Phaser, where you fight waves of enemies, collect upgrades, and try to survive increasingly difficult encounters. After each wave, you can shop for upgrades to power up your character but enemies will also become stronger and more numerous as the game progresses!

## Key Features

- Mouse-based Movement: Control your character by moving your mouse.
- Automatic Attacks: The player attacks automatically when not moving.
- Enemy AI: Enemies seek out the player and shoot projectiles.
- Upgrade System: Purchase character upgrades between waves. Enemies also scale in difficulty with each round.
- Main Menu + Tutorial: Includes a simple tutorial to help you learn the mechanics.
